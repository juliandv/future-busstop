### An interactive and transparent touch screen bus stop interface

Using an array of 40 Infrared LEDs and an infrared camera, a users finger is tracked as it comes in contact with with a sheet of acrylic, creating an interactive multitouch surface.

Behind the arylic is a transparent rear projection film which allows the display to remain transparent while being projected upon. We see this type of technology being implemented in bus stops windows, for displaying up to date bus routes and other relevant info.
